## ðŸ›° Hi!

I build electronic systems for harsh environments (like space). Everything is open source, so check out [PyCubed](https.pycubed.org), [KickSat-2](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/kicksat), or [V-R3X](vr3x.space) missions for more details!

## ðŸ›  Like prototyping electronics?

Check out my [soldering tutorial](https://maholli.com/soldering) used in Stanford's EE department

Or build a [SAM32](https://maholli.com/sam32), a "swiss-army knife" for embedded projects
